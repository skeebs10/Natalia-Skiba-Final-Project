## Tonic Tusk 

A simple web app I built for my own business and passion project. The goal of my company, Tonic Tusk LLC based in Chicago, is to build a brand around CBD products that help promote improving general wellness. The logo is designed to look like a tooth and a elephant and we plan to donate a portion of sales to help save the elephants ‚ù§Ô∏è - perfect formula to keep up with oral care & end ivory tusk poaching ü¶∑ üêò.

## Wireframes

I have drafted up my wireframes by sketch then Figma. I was very influenced by the simple layout of a shopify template and customized it to better fit my store. Follow my link: https://www.figma.com/file/mXjymhUIffz0ZlQUNgHgoJ/Tonic-Tusk?node-id=0%3A1.

#BIG WIN

I integrated a form of payment for my customers to be able to checkout their shopping cart. I'm only offering a few items at the moment but hoping to grow to more SkU's. 

#BIGGEST STRUGGLE

My biggest struggle was my daily juggle of working towards UX/UI research and design of my website, completing my high end website, getting photography for my website, finding and collaborating with supplier for my CBD gum and CBD mint product, studying for the code exam, and creating my portfolio while working a full time job. These past few weeks were beyond busy but most rewarding. 

I am happy I was able to build off my Unit 2 project and use my work coworkers as a resource in the office along with putting it all together these last few weeks!
